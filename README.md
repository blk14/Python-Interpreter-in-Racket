  
  This application is in Racket and has the aim to be an interpreter for python language. It is able to read and to do a minimum
set of operations such as: add, subtract, multiply or divide, but also it is able to recognise and to iterate through while or
for loops for which it has to do comparations and conditional jumps. It is using Cpython with a stack machine model.
